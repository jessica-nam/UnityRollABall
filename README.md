# UnityRollABall - Soccer
CS 328 Assignment One

I first changed the material of my ball to a different URP shader. I tried to go with a legacy shader such as diffuse but quickly realized they were not interchangeable as this project was built in the URP environment. So I am using the URP 2D Sprite Lit shader so that I could apply my soccer ball sprite to the player object.
